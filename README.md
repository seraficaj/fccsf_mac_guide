## How to use this guide
Based on discussion within our chapter's membership, we agreed that there needed to be a resource for setting up one's own computer for web development outside of the in-browser workspaces that freeCodeCamp provides early in the curriculum. Setting up a working dev environment is important for success later in the full-stack certifications. This guide will help you set up your Mac computer to fully participate in our chapter's activities and your own learning.

## What will be installed on my computer?
- Zsh (with Oh-My-Zsh configuration)
- VSCode (+ some optional helpful extensions)
- Git
- Node.js
- NPM 
- Python3
- Django
- Heroku CLI
- MongoDB
- PostgreSQL
- Spectacle (Window Resizer/Manager tool for Mac OS)
- Slack (Desktop App recommended for chapter news/discussions!)

^These tools will allow you to follow the freeCodeCamp curriculum and fully participate in most of our chapter's activities including hackathons, open-source projects, and to even launch your own! There are other programming languages and frameworks you may be interested in such as Ruby, Rails, and PHP. We may add those in the future! 

Please read the FAQ section before continuing to look over the installation instructions.

## FAQ
- *Why do I have to install all this software on my computer?*
- We recommend following this guide for a seamless experience working with the freeCodeCamp curriculum and other learning resources that were designed with UNIX-based operating systems like Linux or Mac OS. Many tools used in the FCC curriculum are best managed with a UNIX OS terminal.

- *What recommended specs/kind of computer do you recommend for learning web development at freeCodeCamp SF?*
   - Here are some recommended specs for any computer:
      - Processor: Intel i5, Intel i7 or equivalent and above. 
      - RAM: at least 8GB (16GB or more recommended for remote work)
      - Storage: 128GB or more available storage
      - Released in the last 4 years
   - Most Macbook Pro configurations will meet these requirements. You can also ask around if you're curious about other Campers' set-ups! Some campers also use Macbook Air computers with these specs, too! :)

- *Can I use a chromebook at freeCodeCamp SF?*
   - You can definitely get through the very early parts of the front-end and full-stack certifications on freeCodeCamp.org using a chromebook. In fact, some of the early front-end projects will be coded entirely on online workspaces like codepen.io. However, the curriculum will quickly become difficult if you are not able to move away from freeCodeCamp's in-browser workspaces and start working with the back-end or using front-end libraries like React or Vue.
   - We recommend getting a Linux, Mac OS, WSL computer as soon as possible to establish a working dev environment for yourself. You will need a fully-featured operating system to practice controlling your computer with the command line and using professional development tools and systems like Git or a code editor. There are guides to setting up a dev environment on chromebooks, but we haven't many of them to be friendly to beginners. For this reason, we recommend following this installation guide.
